// Planned Letter Text:
// Hey [playername], I wanted to let you know that I've gotten a new catalogue for selling herb and flower seeds! I heard from a friend in the city that demand for floral items has been increasing, so I wanted to get ahead of the curve, and ahead of Jojamart. I can't say I know much about flowers myself, however, so I'll just let you browse the catalogue yourself. I've still got a few kinds of flowers in my own inventory, of course, and I've heard Marnie is selling a few kinds of flowers too. Hope you'll get good use out of it! -Pierre
